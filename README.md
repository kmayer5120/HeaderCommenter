# HeaderCommenter
This is a simple WPF project that I made in order to automate the process of adding a header comment to all of the source files in a project. It is a required part of my school assignments. This makes it simple and easy to add a comment that's formatted. 



## Instructions:

1. Enter all fields for comment header.

2. Pick your file extension to search for.

3. Open desired folder with source files.

4. Click Use Selected Files To Comment to set all of the information for the comments.

5. Click Add Header Comments to write to the list of files.
